## Introduction to Operating Systems
<br>

### What is an Ontology?
What do you understand about the ontology that has been presented for your reading this week? Could you attempt to define an ontology that would be relevant to the system that you are designing for the summative assessment?

### Answer:
What I understood from this weeks reading on ontology is that the presented ontology focuses on service-oriented architecture (SOA) and its relevance during the development phase, remaining independent of the implementation details.

An Ontology that would be relevant for the reporting system we are designing would be "The Dutch Forensics Incident Reporting Ontology." This ontology would define the concepts, relationships, and properties related to cybersecurity incidents and their reporting process. It would include entities such as "Report," "Flaw," "User Roles," "Incident Type," "Severity," "Affected Systems," "Evidence," and "Handling Procedures." The ontology would capture the essential elements and their interconnections within the context of reporting and managing ICT system flaws, enabling better understanding, interoperability, and integration of the system components and data related to cybersecurity incidents.
