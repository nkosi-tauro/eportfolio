### Discussion Topic: 
Select one of the coding weaknesses which have been identified by OWASP and create a flowchart of the steps which may have led to the weakness occurring.    
<br>

**Initial Post**  
I have chosen the "Injection" weakness, which is one of the top vulnerabilities identified by OWASP (OWASP, 2021). Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter (An interpreter here can be for example a website that accepts user input. e.g. to log in) as part of a command or query. This can lead to the execution of malicious code, unauthorized data access, or data loss.

Flowchart of the steps that can lead to the Injection weakness:

```mermaid
graph TD
    B[Website accepts user input]
    B --> C{Validate user input?}
    C -- Yes --> D[Sanitize and/or parameterize user input]
    C -- No --> E[Injection vulnerability]
    D --> F[Use user input in a query or command]
    E --> F
    F --> G[Interpreter processes the query or command]
    G --> H[End]

```


To design software that addresses this weakness, I think a sequence diagram would be most appropriate. 
A Sequence diagram will be able to show the interactions between objects in the system over time. It also helps to identify the flow of data and the points where user input is processed, allowing developers to pinpoint areas that need validation and sanitization.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant System
    participant Validator
    participant Interpreter

    User ->> System: Input data
    System ->> Validator: Validate and sanitize input
    Validator -->> System: Sanitized input
    System ->> Interpreter: Execute query with sanitized input
    Interpreter -->> System: Query result
```


In the above diagram, we can see that no data that is not sanitized will be executed by the interpreter, thus preventing an injection attack. In conclusion, one of the ways Injection vulnerabilities can be prevented is by validating and sanitizing user input before using it in queries or commands.

>Hi Nkosilathi,

>Thank you for your post, I enjoyed reading your analysis of Injection and seeing the different diagrams you have provided.

>Injection is very interesting to think about- as a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious code or commands into a computer program or system, the basic idea is to manipulate input data (OWASP, 2021). The steps involved in Injection are generally as follows: 1. the attacker identifies a vulnerable system, 2. The attacker crafts a payload with malicious code which is injected into the system, 3. the attacker's code or commands are executed by the system (Verma & Shri, 2022). With these steps in mind, I was pleased to see that you demonstrated this process in both your flowchart and UML diagram; your sequence diagram correctly shows the process of preventing such attacks.
>
>To add to your UML diagram, I would only note that it takes a multi-layered approach to prevent Injection attacks (Verma & Shri, 2022). For example, input validation/sanitation, parameterized queries, as well as regular testing and monitoring. To answer Dr Cathrynâ€™s inquiry, there may be certain instances in which user input cannot be validated: there might be inadequate input sanitation (OWASP, 2021). This is because input validation is not enough to prevent injection attacks. Input data should also be sanitized to remove any malicious content, such as SQL or HTML code, before it is used by the application.

>Hi Nkosilathi,
>
>Thank you for your post. Injection vulnerabilities are indeed an exciting topic. "SQL" injections are among the most devastating vulnerabilities, as successful injection attacks can lead to sensitive data being exposed (Clark, 2012), as you have rightly mentioned.
>
>Sanitising user input is vital, so your diagram and proposed solution are a great way of hindering injection attacks. I also think that following the principle of "least privilege" could help prevent such attacks (Jero et al., 2021). If added to your diagram, this could add a further layer of security because even if an attacker could bypass the input sanitation, they would be unable to access sensitive data or at least be heavily restricted in doing so.

### Summary Post ###  

I explored the topic of injection vulnerabilities, particularly focusing on the "Injection" weakness identified by OWASP. Injection flaws occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, leading to the execution of malicious code, unauthorized data access, or data loss.

In response to feedback from my tutor, I incorporated academic references to support my initial analysis. The references provided include Kaur and Kaur (2014), which highlighted that time and resource constraints are a reason for the inability to validate user input. This constraint often arises from security being an afterthought in the software development lifecycle or a lack of developer training and awareness, as mentioned in Belding (2021).

My fellow peer Anna, reinforced the importance of a multi-layered approach to prevent injection attacks, including input validation, sanitisation, parameterized queries, and regular testing and monitoring (Verma & Shri, 2022). She also noted that inadequate input sanitation can hinder validation and that input data should be sanitised to remove malicious content, as outlined in OWASP (2021).

Additionally, Michael suggested adding the principle of least privilege to the diagram I had provided as an additional security measure, limiting access to sensitive data even if an attacker bypasses the input sanitation step (Jero et al., 2021).

In summary, the feedback from Dr Cathryn and contributions from my peers enriched my initial post, providing a comprehensive understanding of injection vulnerabilities, reasons for the inability to validate user input, and suggestions for additional security measures on how to prevent this from occurring.
