## An Introduction to Testing

### Exploring the Cyclomatic Complexity’s Relevance Today
The Cyclomatic Complexity is commonly considered in modules on testing the validity of code design today. However, in your opinion, should it be? Does it remain relevant today? Specific to the focus of this module, is it relevant in our quest to develop secure software? Justify all opinions which support your argument and share your responses with your team.

### Discussion

In my opinion I think that Cyclomatic Complexity is not too relevant today. We can develop secure, maintanable and testable software without the need to worry about an arbitary measurement metric. By following principles like SOLID, developers can are "free" to create software that follows programmings best practices without having to calculate Cyclomatic Complexity(brainhub.eu, n.d.).
