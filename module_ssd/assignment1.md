## [Full Brief](#full-brief) 
For this assessment, you are advised to position yourself and your team as IT Software Consultants and Developers.

You are required to develop an application that provides a secure repository for an organisation with domain-specific requirements. A domain refers to a group of users with similar application and hardware requirements. A domain may be characterised by having:   

periodic pressure on resources (CPU, storage, or the network)
interactive response requirements between request and reply
substantial data download requirements
Such requirements place specific demands on a systemâ€™s operations, and this influences the way that it should be operated and managed.

Domains which you should consider for the purpose of this assignment include:

- the International Space Station (NASA, 2007)
- **the Dutch Police Internet Forensics (Government of the Netherlands, n.d.)** - Chosen Domain
- the Hadron Collider at CERN (The Computer Security Team, 2020)

You can read more about the computer requirements of these systems using the references given. You should choose a single domain to focus your development on, and your system should be tailored to the requirements of this domain. In all domains, a user will need to be able to upload and download data.

**Application requirements**: 

The agreed criteria for successful development are:

- The application should support access via a web browser and/or a command line application that will allow an authenticated user to perform the suite of CRUD capabilities.
- The solution should ensure that all privacy and security regulations are met, including those specified by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (ICO, n.d.)
- Mechanisms should be deployed to minimise the attack surface of the solution. At a minimum, the application should include authentication, authorisation, data encryption, and event monitoring. 
- The organisation would like to see a distributed/microservice version of the application because they have concerns about scalability, and they may wish to extend use to partner organisations on a worldwide basis
- At least two events occurring within and/or around the application should run while the application is live, using a concurrent threading approach. These should be specific and relevant to your chosen domain.  

Your full brief is to:

1. Create a comprehensive design proposal report, describing how you will meet the requirements, and the design and implementation of the solution.
2. You should create a working prototype of your microservice design via a command line (CL) application.

## [Reflection](#reflection)
This was an interesting Team assignment. A lot of research was required, whichh meant that the team had to be in constant communication to avoid any issues. Now that the assignment is complete I realise that communication was one of the key factors that helped my team complete the assignment effectively.
