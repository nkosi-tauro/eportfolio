Hi there, my name is Nkosilathi Tauro, and I am a Developer hailing from Cape Town, RSA. Currently, I am pursuing my postgraduate degree at the University of Essex. I thrive on solving problems, and I often use technology as my tool of choice. I am committed to producing high-quality code, and I take pride in the work that I deliver.

Mentoring others brings me joy, and I enjoy doing it both in-person and virtually. I possess excellent communication skills, which allow me to work well independently or as part of a team. Identifying and solving problems is a strength of mine, and I am always looking to learn and grow.

My areas of expertise include web development, data science, and game development. While I love coding in JavaScript and Python, I am not picky about what languages or stacks I work with. I am a quick learner, and I can adapt to new skills as needed.

This is my University of Essex ePortfolio. 
It will contain all my projects, including some of my research, and will be used to showcase my work.
